# Set-Up-Template
The README is used to provide a brief description of what is in the repository. It acts as a documentation for the repository and should include any information that would be helpful to any random user who comes across the documentation.

Examples of what can be included:

* More Detailed Description of the content in the repository that you deem useful information

* Libraries/Packages used:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages()
```

* Explaining Functions

* Where to Obtain the Data

* ..etc


Best Example is the **State** Repository

In this repoitory, you will find a starting template that can be used in any code. It tells you how you should style your code accordingly. Also included is the *R Style Guide* and a Functions.R file that contains useful functions that can be used in any code. You can either copy and paste the functions you need or read it in as a script

```{r}
# reads in the Functions.R file as a script so you have access to all the functions in the file
source('Functions.R')
```
